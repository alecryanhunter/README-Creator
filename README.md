# README Creator

## Description

The README Creator is a program for automatically generating a professional README file for use in future projects. This project was mostly about using NPM, specifically the Inquirer package, in order to take in input and output it in a organized way.

It taught me a lot about Inquirer, which seems is a very useful package. It also taught me a lot about debugging, since I encountered a lot of syntactical errors with Inquirer and FS. I enjoyed this project, since learning about the badges is something I will definitely use again, but probably not the README Creator itself. I prefer to have fine control over my READMEs.

## Installation

In order to use the README Creator, clone this repo onto your local machine. Make sure you have NODE.js installed. Run the `npm install` command to install the Inquirer module.

## Usage

A video demonstration of the project can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X5VTpgXuOsOCoo2sNAirb1BlZ8RaGwS5/view?usp=share_link)

Navigate to this repository, and run the index.js file using the command `node index.js`. Fill out the prompts, and then your created README will be placed in the 'output' folder.
